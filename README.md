# A multi stream website for the Diablo 3 hardcore community

## Ideas/Goals

- Implement an embedded Twitch "Follow" button
- Provide an alternate viewing experience featuring Picture in Picture (may be a limited feature mode i.e.	no chat)
- Add player profiles with items/skills pulled from Blizzard API

## Thoughts

We should consider how we can improve viewer/player interaction through the site.  What can do that will make viewing the stream via our site be a better experience than viewing on twitch.com?
